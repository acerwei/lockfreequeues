Lock Free Queues:
    - SPSC.h: Single Producer Single Consumer
    - SPBC.h: Single Producer Broadcast
    - SPMC.h: Single Producer Multiple Consumer (uniform item structure))

Memory Types:
    - SingleProcess: consumer and producer in the same process but different threads.
    - IPC (inter-process comunication): shared-memory IPC; consumer and producer in different processes but the same machine.

Test:
    - the cpp files in tests folder.

TO IMPROVE
    - Template the test programs.
    - A mini IPC initializer/manager (eg. init, clear, remove) rather than doing the management in consumer/producer test programs.
    - Code sharing in the LockFree Queues.
    - Error / Exception handling
    - MPMC: similar to SPMC
    - MemType_FileShare: shared-file IPC.
